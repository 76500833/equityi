## Description
- Equity I is a modern FinTech app that allows users to pull data of your favorite stocks as well as pull the top 5 biggest stock movers in both the positive and negative direction. You are also able to click on the ticker symbols or the learn more buttons to pull up a modal with more information about the stock such as the company name, short description, 50 day moving average, 52 day high and 52 day low.

### What was your motivation?
- The motivation behind this project was to build an application with a real world application which we could potentially use to find undervalued companies using algorithms based on their 50 and 200 day averages, 52 week high and lows, and current price. This is still a functionality that is being developed. Stay tuned!

### What problem does it solve?
- It gives users an unbloated, easy to use stock app that can look up stocks, biggest day movers (in a negative and positive direction) and pulling company information without having to sign up for any brokerage applications such as Robinhood or Fidelity.
